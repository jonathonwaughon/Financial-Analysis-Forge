# Financial Analysis Forge

Created by Jonathon Waughon.

Financial Analysis Forge is a Python-based project for building interactive financial analysis tools.  
The goal is to upload financial data (starting with Excel files), inspect it through a web UI, and later run valuation models such as DCF, DDM, and comparables.

This repository is currently an early MVP focused on infrastructure and iteration speed.
